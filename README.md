- 👋 Hi, I’m @Harry2166, but you can call me Harry!
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but mainly in computers, math, video games, history, movies, books, and a lot of other stuff!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Computer Science, but I'm looking to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms in my free time!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate much since I'm a beginner.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter: @TheHarry2166_ (I won't be able to help much but I'm willing to learn!)
